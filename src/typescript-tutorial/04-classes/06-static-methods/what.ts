        STATIC PROPERTIES
            Unlike an instance property, a static property is shared among all instances of a class.
        STATIC METHODS
            Similar to the static property, a static method is also shared across instances of the class. To declare a static method, you use the static keyword before the method name.
        SUMMARY
            Static properties and methods are shared by all instances of a class.
            Use the static keyword before a property or a method to make it static.
