    The TypeScript object type represents any value that is not a primitive value.
The Object type, however, describes functionality that is available on all objects.
The empty type {} refers to an object that has no property on its own.

What intrigued me so much was that the:

let employee:object;
employee={
name:'Tuguldue',
age:20}

Or the alternative amazing :
let employee :{
name:string,
age:number}

Finally ,there are two kind types , which are similar to each other . The object type and Object type . As I understood , one is simply object type , and the other is OBJECT .
